# App
This is my first Xamarin application. It is a mobile app where a user can search for artists. After clicking on an artist, the user can get detailed information about that artist. The information about the artists is retrieved using the Spotify API.

# Installation

## Android
1. Download the SpotifyArtistSearcher.apk file from the [Android_APK](https://github.com/MartinKulev/Xamarin_SpotifyArtistSearcher/tree/master/Android_APK) folder.
2. Run the .apk file on your android device.
3. Open the application.

> [!NOTE]
> You need Android 14.0 to run the application.
